      "mnemonic": "To create a funny and memorable mnemonic image for George Washington, picture this:\n\nA large, bushy green bush (playing on \"George\" which sounds like \"george\" or \"gorge\" as in greenery) wearing colonial clothing and a general's hat is standing on a washing machine (playing on \"Washington\") that's actively spinning. This bush character is also crossing a river made of sudsy, soapy water, reminiscent of Washington crossing the Delaware. The bush holds a boat oar in one hand and a dollar coin in the other, a nod to his face being on the currency.\n\nDALL-E Prompt: \"A cartoon of a green bush dressed in a colonial general's outfit, standing on top of an old-fashioned spinning washing machine as it crosses a sudsy river holding a boat oar and a dollar coin.\"",
