On one of the branches, a tiny, apple-sized caricature of George Washington with a speech bubble saying \"I cannot tell a lie, I'm the first!\". Around the tree, quarters are rolling like wheels, hinting at the common currency featuring his profile.\" \n\nThe cherry tree represents the famous myth where young George supposedly couldn't lie about chopping down his father's tree. The general's hat symbolizes his role in the Revolutionary War, wooden teeth refer to the myth about his dentures, the dollar bill kite signifies his face on the currency, and the quarters rolling around all play into remembering that George Washington is the face we associate with the first U.S. President.",

The cowboy hat adds a personal touch as he is often associated with Texas.",
